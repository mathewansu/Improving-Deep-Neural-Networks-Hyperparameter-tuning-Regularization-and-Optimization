# Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks-Hyperparameter-tuning-Regularization-and-Optimization
Course offered by deeplearning.ai helps in:
- Understanding industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 
- Effectively using the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking, 
- Implemening and applying a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence. 
- Understanding new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
- Implementing a neural network in TensorFlow.
